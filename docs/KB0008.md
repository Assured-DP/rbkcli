 # KB0008 - List storage stats of all protected Objects
 
 ### Basic Usage
 - Endpoint: `/cmdlets/objects/protected/storage_stats`
 In order to run this cmdlet you must run:
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected storage_stats
 ```
 For better visibility you can use the json table converter:
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected storage_stats --table
 ```
 
 ### Description
 
 This is a default cmdlet, which provides a list of all objects, their local storage and storage growth, the data comes from System Capacity report. It will return a json list of results with the following fields: ObjectName, Location, ObjectState, ObjectType, SlaDomain, LocalStorage, LocalStorageGrowth.
 
 
 ### Technical Info Breakdown
 
 Following is the original **rbkcli** command, which this **cmdlet** translates to:
 ```
 rbkcli report -f "name=System Capacity,type=Canned" -l id "jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999" -s ObjectName,Location,ObjectState,ObjectType,SlaDomain,LocalStorage,LocalStorageGrowth
 ```
 
 Let's start by understanding the initial command:
 ```
 rbkcli report -f "name=System Capacity,type=Canned"
 ```
 In this command we are querying for all the reports available in Rubrik system and then filtering by the name of "System Capacity" and the type "Canned". 
 
 Moving to the second part of the command we have:
 ```
 --loop id "jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999"
 ```
 With the result received, which is just one, we loop the "id" field into the API endpoint "/jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999". 
 The "/jsonfy/report_table" is a custom script, which requests the following endpoint: "/internal/report/{id}/table" and converts that data into json list of elements.
 Effectively we are requesting a maximum limit of "9999" objects in the results, coming from that report.
 
 For the last part of of the command we have:
 ```
 --select ObjectName,Location,ObjectState,ObjectType,SlaDomain,LocalStorage,LocalStorageGrowth
 ```
 From all the fields generated from the report table requested, we only select those seven above, having a more concise result.
 
 ### Adding it manually
 The command line used to create a cmdlet such as this is:
 ```
 rbkcli cmdlet -m post -p '{"profile": "rbkcli","command": ["rbkcli report -f \"name=System Capacity,type=Canned\" -l id \"jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999\" -s ObjectName,Location,ObjectState,ObjectType,SlaDomain,LocalStorage,LocalStorageGrowth"],"table_order": ["ObjectName", "Location", "ObjectState", "ObjectType", "SlaDomain", "LocalStorage", "LocalStorageGrowth"],"cmdlet_summary": "List all objects and their local storage stats","cmdlet_description": "List all objects, their local storage and storage growth.","name": "objects protected storage_stats","param": "","response_description": "Returns a json list of results with the following fields: ObjectName, Location, ObjectState, ObjectType, SlaDomain, LocalStorage, LocalStorageGrowth."}'
 ```
 
 The response given from rbkcli would be:
 
 ```json
  {
    "result": "Succeeded",
    "message": [],
    "cmdlet_to_add": {
    "id": "e0d5a3ed-6658-44f4-a289-e975be98db54",
    "profile": "rbkcli",
    "name": "objects protected storage_stats",
    "cmdlet_summary": "List all objects and their local storage stats",
    "cmdlet_description": "List all objects, their local storage and storage growth.",
    "command": [
      "rbkcli report -f \"name=System Capacity,type=Canned\" -l id \"jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999\" -s ObjectName,Location,ObjectState,ObjectType,SlaDomain,LocalStorage,LocalStorageGrowth"
    ],
    "table_order": [
      "ObjectName",
      "Location",
      "ObjectState",
      "ObjectType",
      "SlaDomain",
      "LocalStorage",
      "LocalStorageGrowth"
    ],
    "multiple_output": "segmented",
    "param": "",
    "response_description": "Returns a json list of results with the following fields: ObjectName, Location, ObjectState, ObjectType, SlaDomain, LocalStorage, LocalStorageGrowth."
    }
  }
 ```
 
 ### Further usage
 Additional usage for this command line could be:
 - Filtering by object type, type which is equal to "ManagedVolume":
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected storage_stats -f ObjectType=ManagedVolume -T
 ```
 - Searching for an object by SLA domain name, name which contains "Silver":
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected storage_stats -f SlaDomain~Silver -T
 ```
 - Filtering by object growth, growth which does not contains "-" (negative sign) nor is equal to "0":
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected storage_stats -f LocalStorageGrowth\!~- -f LocalStorageGrowth\!=0 -T
 ```
