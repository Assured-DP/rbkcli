# KB0017 - Use rbkcli with a proxy/VPN

## Problem

When using a VPN or port forwarding to reach the cluster, even after first command has been run, **rbkcli** insists in downloading the API documentation every time.

1. You configure target port forwarding to your local IP address. 
	Example: (<target_ip>:443) -> (127.0.0.1:1200). 

2. You set the target with the following commands:
	```
	export rubrik_cdm_node_ip=127.0.0.1:1200
	export rubrik_cdm_username=admin
	export rubrik_cdm_password=Password
	```
3. When any command is run you see the following:
	```
	$ rbkcli cluster me
	EnvironmentHandler # No cached API found for this target, importing APIs...
	```
	
4. When looking at *rbkcli.log* file you see entries similar to the following for **every** command you run:
	```

	```


## Explanation
As stated in **rbkcli** documentation, the tool functionality and it's available APIs depends on the target being provided. In order for rbkcli to optimize its usability, it will save the data related to each target and it will rely on its IP to resolve what target are we connecting to.

1. The resolution file.
	For each target you connect to, rbkcli will update the **~/rbkcli/conf/target_resolution.json** file with all nodes of the target cluster. In that way, if you change the node but connect to the same cluster **rbkcli** will use the same cached data for API profiles.
	Following is an example of what the content of the **~/rbkcli/conf/target_resolution.json** file, after first command was run:
	```
	[
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001337",
		"ip": "192.168.0.10"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001500",
		"ip": "192.168.0.1"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001616",
		"ip": "192.168.0.2"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001650",
		"ip": "192.168.0.3"
	  }
	]
	```
	**rbkcli** will keep trying to find target with IP:port which is equal to: *127.0.0.1:1200* as defined, however once the source of the data cached is always the local IP for that node, it will never match and therefor will always try to cache the environment again.

## Resolution
The resolution for this situation is quite simple, modify the resolution file to match the entered IP address and port.

1. The file after modification should be similar to the following:
	```
	[
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001337",
		"ip": "192.168.0.10"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001500",
		"ip": "127.0.0.1:1200"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001616",
		"ip": "192.168.0.2"
	  },
	  {
		"envId": "a8cd537d-e274-46d8-871e-f80ac47c264c",
		"envName": "ORK-Support",
		"id": "RVMHM184S001650",
		"ip": "192.168.0.3"
	  }
	]
	```

2. Once that is done, any commands should now use the existing cache:
	```
	$ rbkcli node_management hostname
	"RVMHM184S001500"
	```
