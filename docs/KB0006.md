 # KB0006 - List all protected Objects
 
 ### Basic Usage
 - Endpoint: `/cmdlets/objects/protected/`
 
 In order to run this cmdlet you must run:
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected
 ```
 For better visibility you can use the json table converter:
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected --table
 ```
 
 ### Description
 
 This is a default cmdlet, which provides a list all objects that are or were protected, the data comes from Object Protection Summary report. It will return a json list of results with the following fields in the respective order: ObjectId, ObjectName, ObjectState, ObjectType. 
 
 
 ### Technical Info Breakdown
 
 Following is the original **rbkcli** command, which this **cmdlet** translates to:
 ```
 rbkcli report -f "name=Object Protection Summary,type=Canned" -l id "jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999" -s ObjectId,ObjectName,ObjectState,ObjectType
 ```
 
 Let's start by understanding the initial command:
 ```
 rbkcli report -f "name=Object Protection Summary,type=Canned" 
 ```
 In this command we are querying for all the reports available in Rubrik system and then filtering by the name of "Object Protection Summary" and the type "Canned". 
 
 Moving to the second part of the command we have:
 ```
 --loop id "jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999"
 ```
 With the result received, which is just one, we loop the "id" field into the API endpoint "/jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999". 
 The "/jsonfy/report_table" is a custom script, which requests the following endpoint: "/internal/report/{id}/table" and converts that data into json list of elements.
 Effectively we are requesting a maximum limit of "9999" objects in the results, comming from that report.
 
 For the last part of of the command we have:
 ```
 --select ObjectId,ObjectName,ObjectState,ObjectType
 ```
 From all the fields generated from the report table requested, we only select those four above, having a more concise result.
 
 ### Adding it manually
 The command line used to create a cmdlet such as this is:
 ```
 rbkcli cmdlet -m post -p '{"profile": "rbkcli","command": ["rbkcli report -f \"name=Object Protection Summary,type=Canned\" -l id \"jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999\" -s ObjectId,ObjectName,ObjectState,ObjectType"],"table_order": ["ObjectId", "ObjectName", "ObjectState", "ObjectType"],"cmdlet_summary": "List all objects that are or were protected.","cmdlet_description": "List all objects that are or were protected, the data comes from Object Protection Summary report.","name": "objects protected","param": "","response_description": "Returns a json list of results with the following fields: ObjectId, ObjectName, ObjectState, ObjectType."}'
 ```
 
 The response given from rbkcli would be:
 
 ```json
 {
  "result": "Succeeded",
  "message": [],
  "cmdlet_to_add": {
    "id": "39e9e4d6-f85a-4acc-aa2b-29771ad14855",
    "profile": "rbkcli",
    "name": "objects protected",
    "cmdlet_summary": "List all objects that are or were protected.",
    "cmdlet_description": "List all objects that are or were protected, the data comes from Object Protection Summary report.",
    "command": [
      "rbkcli report -f \"name=Object Protection Summary,type=Canned\" -l id \"jsonfy/report_table -p report_id={id},limit=9999\" -s ObjectId,ObjectName,ObjectState,ObjectType"
    ],
    "table_order": [
      "ObjectId",
      "ObjectName",
      "ObjectState",
      "ObjectType"
    ],
    "multiple_output": "segmented",
    "param": "",
    "response_description": "Returns a json list of results with the following fields: ObjectId, ObjectName, ObjectState, ObjectType."
  }
}
 ```
 
 ### Further usage
 Additional usage for this command line could be:
 - Filtering by object type, type which is equal to "Mssql":
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected -f ObjectType=Mssql -T
 ```
 - Searching for an object by name, name which contains "Win2012":
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected -f ObjectName~Win2012 -T
 ```
 - Filtering by object status, not "Active" objects:
 ```
 $ rbkcli objects protected -f ObjectState!=Active -T
 ```
