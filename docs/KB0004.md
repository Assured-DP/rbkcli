# KB0004 - Get all failed events related to VMware VMs by date.

This is an example of a complex command, it calls a existing API on Rubrik systems, using API queries and json filters.

## Usage
To get all the failed events related to VMware VMs on the 7th of August and also get the failure message, run the following command:

```
$ rbkcli event -q "after_date=2019-08-06T23:59:59,before_date=2019-08-08T00:00:01,status=Failure,object_type=VmwareVm,limit=100" -f eventType!=Archive -s time,objectName,eventType,eventStatus,[eventInfo][message] -T
```

## Command breakdown:

1. Finding out what command to run:
	Supposing you want to run a command that brings "event" related information, to find out which similar command is available, you can run:

	```
	$ rbkcli commands -f endpoint~event -T
	 version  | endpoint                       | method | summary
	=====================================================================================================================================
	 internal | event count_by_job_type        | get    | Get counts of job related events
	 internal | event count_by_status          | get    | Get counts of job related events
	 internal | event                          | get    | Get information for specified events
	 internal | event_series {id} status       | get    | Get information for a specific event
	 internal | event_series {id}              | get    | Get events associated with an event series
	 internal | event_series {status} csv_link | get    | Get the link for CSV file of the current monitoring dashboard specified by ID.
	 internal | event_series                   | get    | Get information for specified event series

	**Total amount of objects [7]
	```

	In here you are specifying that you only want to see commands available that contains the word "event" in the endpoint field.

2. Getting information on what is the return of that command:
	To get more information about any command you can add "-i" argument to it.

	```

	```

	To get information on available data returned by the command you can add a "-s ?MAP"  argument to it and run:

	```
	$ rbkcli event -s ?MAP
	[eventInfo]
	[eventProgress]
	[eventSeriesId]
	[eventStatus]
	[eventType]
	[id]
	[isCancelRequested]
	[isCancelable]
	[jobInstanceId]
	[notificationId]
	[objectId]
	[objectName]
	[objectType]
	[relatedIds]
	[time]
	[warningCount]
	```

3. Creating the desired query:
	Based on the 12 available parameters for this API, you can create a query that will match your needs:
	 - Specific date: We can only specify before and after a certain point in time. As we want to get a full day worth of events, we have to specify dates that comprehend that day:
		 ```
		 after_date=2019-08-06T23:59:59,before_date=2019-08-08T00:00:01
		 ```
	 
	 - Specific type of Object: There is a parameter for type of object and once we want Vmware VMs, we can use the value accordingly:
		 ```
		 object_type=VmwareVm
		 ```
	 - Amount of results returned: There is a default limit to return the latest 25 results with event API, if you want more results you can increase that to a maximum value of 9.999:
		 ```
		 limit=100
		 ```

5. Creating filters for the end results:
	There might be issues you are aware of and wants to ignore, for example: You already know your archive location is not accessible, therefore you might want to ignore any issues related to archival events. You can create a filter to remove all events of archival type:
	```
	-f eventType!=Archive
	```
	Effectively you are requesting to only show results different than eventType being Archive.

6. Choosing the output order and properties:
	In order to select the fields desired you can add "-s" and each desired field, such as the following:
	```
	$ rbkcli event -f eventType!=Archive -s time,objectName,eventType,eventStatus,[eventInfo][message]
	[
	  {
		"time": "Thu Aug 08 10:42:35 UTC 2019",
		"objectName": "model",
		"eventType": "Backup",
		"eventStatus": "Success",
		"eventInfo_message": "Completed backup of the transaction log for SQL Server database 'model' from '192.168.75.86\\MSSQLSERVER'"
	  },
	  {
		"time": "Thu Aug 08 10:41:33 UTC 2019",
		"objectName": "S3Compatible:rbk-arch-hugh",
		"eventType": "Configuration",
		"eventStatus": "Failure",
		"eventInfo_message": "Failed to connect to S3Compatible archival location 'S3Compatible:rbk-arch-hugh'. Connectivity check failed."
	  },
	  [...]
	```

7. To convert that result into a table, you can add "-T" argument to it and run:
	```
	$ rbkcli event -f eventType!=Archive -s time,objectName,eventType,eventStatus,[eventInfo][message] -T
	 time                         | objectName                           | eventType     | eventStatus | eventInfo_message                                                                                                                       
	================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

	 Thu Aug 08 10:42:35 UTC 2019 | model                                | Backup        | Success     | Completed backup of the transaction log for SQL Server database 'model' from '192.168.75.86\MSSQLSERVER'     
	[...]

	**Total amount of objects [21]

	```

8. Finally select the desired query, field and format and run the command:
	```
	$ rbkcli event -q "after_date=2019-08-06T23:59:59,before_date=2019-08-08T00:00:01,status=Failure,object_type=VmwareVm,limit=100" -f eventType!=Archive -s time,objectName,eventType,eventStatus,[eventInfo][message] -T
	 time                         | objectName                    | eventType | eventStatus | eventInfo_message
